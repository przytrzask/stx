This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
### About
It is basic App created espacially for Stx next company as application for workshops.
By doing this app instead of simply implementing requirements I also wanted to try some new react features like new hooks and suspense API
### Start
Start using `yarn/npm start`
### Something Missing?
I belive it meets all requirements but tests are missing due to lack of time and also there is no well documented how to tests hooks yet.
